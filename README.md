# Go big!

Go is a great language with very powerful elements that makes building applications to handle big data
more effective than ever.

Unfortunatelly, like many other languages, its standard library provides elementary building
blocks that perform very well with thousands of elements but need to be wrapped with a more
complex layer in order to scale up efficiently.

Here come Go-big, it is a project focused into finding general and efficient solutions when number of
elements to be processed is around the million and where all machine CPUs and memory need to be
properly allocated for the task.

Problems under study up to now:
- Sorting big number of elements.
